1) **The Agile Manifesto**: [http://agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org).    
Go read it. And [read the history](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html) of why, and how, it came to be. Oh, and [don't skip the principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Then listen to [Agile Uprising's interviews of 13 of the 17 Manifesto signatories](http://podcast.agileuprising.com/manifesto-author-review/).

2) **Agile Product Ownership in a nutshell** [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE) by Henrik Kniberg (there's also a blogpost with a full transcription: http://blog.crisp.se/2012/10/25/henrikkniberg/agile-product-ownership-in-a-nutshell)

3) **The Scrum Guide**: [http://scrumguides.org](http://scrumguides.org)    
Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber created Scrum in 1993/1995 (depending on whom you want to believe) and they don't hate each other anymore so The Scrum Guide has been consolidated after they split their efforts between Scrum Alliance and Scrum.org

4) **Kanban**: Read [Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Business](http://www.djaa.com/kanban-successful-evolutionary-change-your-technology-business-0) by David Anderson. He was the first to write about using Kanban in software. While you're at it, read [Personal Kanban](http://personalkanban.com/pk/) by Jim Benson, the arguable creator of Kanban.

5) **Extreme Programming**: Read [Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201616416/extremeprogrammi), then read this [XP primer](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), then watch Kent Beck's '[20 Years Later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGuTmOUdFbo&lipi)' talk on XP. While you're at it, read about the [C3 project](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/C3.html).

6) "**Agile Testing**" - Read Brian Marick's [original post here](http://www.exampler.com/old-blog/2003/08/22/#agile-testing-project-2), and Lisa Crispin's [awesome refresher here](http://lisacrispin.com/2011/11/08/using-the-agile-testing-quadrants/). I put 'Agile Testing' in quotes because testing is a team sport. Don't use this as a way to make your testers agiler, that's just dumb. Oh, and Grammarly said to use 'agiler' instead of 'more agile'.

7) **Read** [**everything by Jerry Weinberg**](http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/Site/Bundles.html). Well, that might take a lifetime, so [start with these](https://leanpub.com/b/qualitysoftware). Just about everyone who's considered to be an '_agile thinker_' (whatever that means) has been influenced by Jerry in one way or another.

8) **Read** [Coaching Technical Practices](https://www.infoq.com/articles/coaching-technical-practices) by Pedro Santos, a really nice list of subjects to help you coaching around XP practices, specifically TDD, Pair Programming, Refactoring and Simple Design.

**Honourable Mention**: Look up the [Manifesto authors](http://agilemanifesto.org/authors.html) in your spare time.
